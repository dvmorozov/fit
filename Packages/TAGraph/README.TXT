TAChart is a charting LGPL component for Lazarus (TeeChart LineSerie like). 
It contains the functions I need  for the TeleAuto project but I'll improve 
it in the future.

Its main caracteristics are :

    * Unlimited number of  graphs
    * Unlimited number of points
    * Graph legend
    * Graph title
    * Axis labels
    * Interactive zoom
    * Reticule or vertical reticule with point measure
    * Line drawing between points
    * Point drawing on each point
    * Different point shapes (square,circle, cross, diagonal cross and star)
    * Color each point and line
    * Mirror on X axis
    * Auto or manual graph limits
    * Linear least square fitting
    * Smart marks drawing
    * Vertical and horizontal line graph type
    * Easily extensible to new graph types

Tested with
