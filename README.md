# fit

The curve fitting application. It allows to model data by set of curves of selected type.

Fully automatical mode is available.

The application is written in Free Pascal with Lazarus (Delphi is not supported) and is working under Windows and Linux (potentially could be compiled for Mac, but this was not done yet).

#### Win64

On Windows MathExpr.dll should be put in the same directory as Fit.exe (this enables experimental feature of curves having shapes defined by arbitrary expression, but it is not supported under Linux for now).

#### Linux-x86_64
