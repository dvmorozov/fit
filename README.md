# fit

The curve fitting application. It allows to model data by set of curves of selected type.

Fully automatical mode is available.

The application is written in Free Pascal with Lazarus (Delphi is not supported) and is working under Windows and Linux (potentially could be compiled for Mac, but this was not done yet).

#### Win64

[Fit](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-win64/Fit-x86_64-win64.exe)
[MathExpr](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-win64/MathExpr.dll)

MathExpr.dll should be put in the same directory as Fit.exe.

The project should be built with "Windows specific" option.

#### Linux-x86_64

[Fit](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-linux/Fit-x86_64-linux)

The project should be built with "Portable" option.

### Command line parameters

__/INFILE=*file_name*__ - opens data file on application start up 

__/WRITE_PARAMS_LOG__ - turns on logging of variable parameters

On Windows log file is located in the folder
