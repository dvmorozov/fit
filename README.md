# fit

The curve fitting application. It allows to model data by set of curves of selected type.

Fully automatical mode is available.

The application is written in Free Pascal with Lazarus (Delphi is not supported) and is working under Windows and Linux (potentially could be compiled for Mac, but this was not done yet).

### Binaries

There is no installer. The main executable is Fit.exe.

#### Win64

[Fit](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-win64/Fit-x86_64-win64.exe)
[MathExpr](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-win64/MathExpr.dll)

Build with "Windows specific" mode (see project options).

#### Linux-x86_64

[Fit](https://github.com/dvmorozov/fit/raw/master/Desktop/o/x86_64-linux/Fit-x86_64-linux)

Build with "Portable" mode.

On Windows MathExpr.dll should be put in the same directory as Fit.exe (this enables experimental feature of curves having shapes defined by arbitrary expression, but it is not supported under Linux for now).

#### Win32

These versions are not maintained and will be replaced.
